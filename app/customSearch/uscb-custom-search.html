        <h4>Description</h4>
        <h5>Purpose</h5>
        <p>Search widgets are means for users to look for content without manually clicking through the web page.</p>
        <h5>Usage</h5>
        <p>Search widgets can take on a variety of aesthetic qualities, but they essentially serve similar purposes: to find content without having to dive into web pages using many clicks. These widgets are most commonly known as "Search Bars," and include an area for text input and a call to action that initiates the search. Conventional search bars also include predictive text, which completes users' search terms using character matching algorithms.</p>
        <h5>Types</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Single Search bar</li>
            <li>Results Search</li>
            <li>Filter Search</li>
            <li>Maps tool Search</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Do</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide predictive text to help users find what they need.</li>
            <li>Differentiate different kinds of queries in the predictive texts by section (tables, keywords, etc.).</li>
            <li>Take advantage of both global search bar patterns and local search bar patterns.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Do not</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Overcomplicate the search bar.</li>
            <li>Make too many search bars.</li>
        </ul>
